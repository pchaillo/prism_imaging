Prerequisites (For development purposes):
_ Matlab v.2022b:
	- Bioinformatics Toolbox
	- Communications Toolbox
	- Computer Vision Toolbox
	- Control System Toolbox
	- Data Acquisition Toolbox
	- DSP System Toolbox
	- Image Acquisition Toolbox
	- Image Processing Toolbox
	- Industrial Communication Toolbox
	- Instrument Control Toolbox
	- Mapping Toolbox
	- MATLAB Coder
	- MATLAB Compiler
	- Medical Imaging Toolbox 
	- Robotics System Toolbox
	- Signal Processing Toolbox
	- Simulink
	- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
	- Parallel Computing Toolbox
_ Windows or Linux-based sysem

For first use : 
_ Launch the 'LAUNCH_FOR_FIRST_USE.bat' file included at the root of the source code. 
It will install every required python library, and Python 3.8 

If a Python-based error is encountered: 
_ Launch Matlab v.2022b
_ On the MatLab Command Window, in the middle of the screen, write the following:
pyenv('Version','%Your Python installation directory%\python.exe')

If you have not modified the installation location of Python 3.8, it should look like this:	
pyenv('Version','C:\Python38\python.exe')

_ Navigate to the prism_imaging folder on the left of the screen
_ Double click mapping_APP_7.mlapp
_ Click run in the top left of the screen once the option becomes available. Do NOT 
change anything in the app designer tool.
